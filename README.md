Inspired by Monet. Designed for Play.

### Project Description  
Claude Monet, a French artist and a leading figure of the impressionist movement, was deeply inspired by nature – not just in his paintings but in the garden he created at his home in Giverny, France. Designed as a living work of art, the garden is known for its flowers, tranquil pond, floating water lilies, and the iconic bridge. It became the subject of many of Monet’s famous paintings, capturing the beauty of the landscape.

This mini-mini golf course, inspired by Monet’s garden, invites you to move through a landscape of greenery and water, choosing your own route – cross the bridge for a scenic path or putt your way through the water and weave past floating lily pads and swans. This course offers an experience that reflects the beauty and atmosphere of Monet’s Garden.
